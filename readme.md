This project is a Results Summary Component inspired by a Frontend Mentor challenge. It visually displays a user’s performance score alongside a breakdown of individual categories such as Reaction, Memory, Verbal, and Visual.

## Overview

The goal of this project was to design a simple yet elegant component that summarizes test results in a visually appealing format. The layout includes a gradient results card and a clean summary section with category scores.

### Features

* Displays an overall score and performance feedback.
* Shows detailed category scores with distinct colors and icons.
* Fully responsive — stacks neatly on smaller screens.
* Clean modern design with soft shadows and rounded edges.

## Built With

* **HTML5** – for semantic structure.
* **CSS3** – for layout, styling, and responsiveness.

## What I Learned

During this project, I learned:

* How to **overlay one box slightly over another** to create depth and visual interest.
* How to **use CSS grid and flexbox** for clean alignment and spacing.
* How to **apply gradients and soft shadows** for a polished interface.
* How to maintain a **consistent color palette** and typography.

## Responsive Design

* The layout adapts smoothly to all screen sizes.
* On mobile devices, the sections stack vertically with consistent spacing and proportions.
